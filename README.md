It is known that Prophet can effectively decompose time trends, and LSTM can incorporate additional information into training.

Similarly, if there is no time series, XGBoost can also be used to train other information for prediction. 

So, what if we include the time trends decomposed by Prophet as features in the training? 

Wouldn't this take both time trends and additional information into account?"
